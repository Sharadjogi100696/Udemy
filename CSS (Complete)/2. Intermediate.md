Box Model:

- every element in html is interpreted as box by css
- margin
- border
- padding
- content
- by default, body has margin of 8px

## Margin Collapsing:

- if Box1 has marginBottom as 10px
- and Box2 has marginTop as 10px

- distance b/w Box1 and Box2 will be 10px (bigger margin wins)

### Cases:

- Adjacent Siblings
- A parent with children that have a margin
- An empty element with margins (without padding, content, height,width)
- in general, we should use either margin-top or margin-bottom

## ShortHand Property

```
border: 2px solid red;

margin: top right bottom left
margin: topBottom letfRight
margin: topRightBottomLeft
```

## width and height

- block level element always has full width set
- width or height in percentage will be in respect to parent box model (by default)
- for setting height to 100%,

```
    set html height to 100%
    set body height to 100%
    set div height to 100%
```

## Box Sizing

- When using height and width, padding or border doesn't add upto that (default behaviour)
- to make it part of width/height

```
    add box-sizing: border-box
    box-sizing: content-box (default value)
```

- (include it in the universal selector)

## Block Elements

- for block elements, we can set margin/padding
- Block-level elements are rendered as a block and hence take up all the available horizontal space.

## Inline Elements

- They also use the box-model
- but margin-top and margin-bottom have no effect on the element- padding-top and padding-bottom also have a different effect- They don't push the adjacent content away but they will do so with the element border.
- setting a width or height on an inline element also has no effect.
- any vertical padding/margin/border have no effect
- Inline elements on the other hand only take up the space they require to fit their content in.

## Inline Block Elements

- so we have mixture of both as inline-block

## Display

```
    display: block, inline, inline-block, flex, none, etc
```

- If you only want to hide an element
- but you want to keep its place
- (i.e- other elements don't fill the empty spot),
- you can use visibility: hidden; instead of display: none;

## calc

```
calc(100% - 48px)
```

## vertical align

```
vertical align: middle --> to the child elements to set it in the middle
```

## pseudo class

- defines the style of a special state of an element

```
a:hover {}
a:active {}

div:first-child
```

```
:not()
```

- reverse a certain rule
- exclude a certain selector

```
:not(p) {...} --> style everything except 'p'
```

## pseudo elements

- defines the style of a specific part of an element

```
:: elementName
```

```
p::first-letter
```

```
:: after
:: before
```

- allows to render the content through CSS

```
.className::after {
content: "$"
}
```

- content property is mandatory

## Grouping Rules

```
.class1, .class2 {...}

a.class1 {...}

h1.class2 {...}

background image:

background: url('path')

!important
```

- overwrites specifity and all the other selectors
- should be used rarely

## outline:

- comes after border.
- to make the element standout
- focus default for inputs or button

## float:

- override the default position and tell the browser to push elem left/right
- take it out of the document flow

- to solve this issue, add another div with

```
clear: both
```

## Notes

```
rgb(0,0,0)
rgba(0,0,0,0.5)
```

```
border-radius: 50%;
```

- class is more connected to CSS
- use assigning class more
