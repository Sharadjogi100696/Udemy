## About:

- pre-rendering
- hydrate with react code once loaded
- only affects the initial load

## Two forms for pre-rendering:

1. static generation
2. server side

## Static Generation

- pre-generate the page during build time before deployment
- pages are prepared ahead of time
- pages are cached on the server/CDN serving the app

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {...}
```

- code inside getStaticProps are not included in bundle which is sent to client
- secrets are protected

- problem: since it is pre-rendered during build time, what happens if data changes frequently ? or after the page is deployed ?
- do we need to re deploy it again ?

1. one traditional appraoch --> use useEffect to load the data in the backgroud and render
2. Incremental Static Generation

- regenerate the page on every x seconds on every request
- no need of redeployment

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return { props, revalidate: 10 }; // 10 sec
}
```

## notFound key

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return { props, revalidate: 10, notFound: true }; // 10 sec
}
```

- why ? if data failed to load, we can show user not found page

## redirect key

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    props,
    revalidate: 10,
    redirect: {
      destination: "/no-data",
    },
  };
}
```

- helps, when data fails to load

## params:

```jsx
const { params } = context;
```

## problem: for dynamic routes, SSG throws error

```jsx
getStaticPaths;
```

## getStaticPaths

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { id: "1" } },
      { params: { id: "2" } },
      { params: { id: "3" } },
    ],
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

- next will call getStaticProps 3 times with different params
- it generates .json file, which is fetched on the client when it sees a link of details page

## fallback ?

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
    return {paths: [{params: {id: '1'}}}], fallback: true}
}
```

- when true, if any id is not present, it will again load the page with that id
- when we use fallback, we should also handle the UI for loading state, because it will take some to load the data to solve above problem, use fallback: 'blocking'

## what if id is not available:

- case 1: using fallback: false --> not found page
- case 2: using fallback: true --> tries to get the data, throws error
- case 3: using fallback: true --> if no item --> return {notFound: true}

## Notes:

- by default, next js pre-renders pages that have no dynamic data
- we can do server side data fetching from the filesystems.
- next js by default exclude all the server side code + imports

```
fs.readFile --> to read the filesystems
path --> to compute the path
process.cwd --> gives current work directory
JSON.parse --> parse the data returned by fs
```

- when we run `npm run build`, we see some info in the terminal:

```
lemda --> server side only page
circle outlined --> static html data
circle --> static pre-generated page
```

## getServerSideProps

- allows to pre-render for every request
- executed on the server after deployment
- we need request
- we need cookies

```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {...}
```

- it has all the fields except revalidate from getStaticProps
- no need of getStaticPaths, since no need of pre-generating the dynamic pages

## context

```js
const { params, req, res } = context; // req, res are not available in getStaticProps
```

---

## client side data fetching:

- some data doesn't need pre-render.

- stock data
- specific client data
- partial data

## useSWR

- hook to load data in efficient way

```
npm install swr
```

```js
useSWR(<request-url>, (url) => fetch(url).then(res => res.json()))
```
