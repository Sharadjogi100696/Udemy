## Server Side Sessions

- client login --> send request with user/pass
- server validates, creates and store unique Id and send it back
- client uses the same id to talk to the server again

## Authentication Tokens

- client login --> send request with user/pass
- server validates, create (not store) tokens and signs in and send it to the client
- client uses that token to communicate
- server knows how it signed and able to recognize the token

## Notes:

- frontend is detached from backend
- server dont store anything client specific
- but client need Authentication

```
JWT (Json Web Tokens)
```

## JWT

It has 3 parts:

1. Issuer Data (Server attach metadata (preconfigured by 3rd party package))
2. custom data (eg. user data)
3. secret key signing (never shared to client)

```
Issuer Data + custom data ---> signed (not encrypted)
```

## next-auth: (3rd party lib)

- allows client/server validations
- generate JWTs
- wont manage user creation
