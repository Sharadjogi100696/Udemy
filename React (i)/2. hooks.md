# React Hooks:

- all the react hooks must be called inside the components directly (not nested)

## useState:

```
    const [value,setValue] = useState('initial value')
```

- useState tells react to re-render the component

- returns an array of value and function to change the value
- React registers this value in its memory for that component and whenever setValue is called, react re-avaluate that component wherever value is used
- setValue callback function is aynchronous

- per component instance basis

- use it more for rendering stuff not for playing local variables

- For states, which depends on previous state:

```
        useState((prevState) => {return {...prevState}})
```

```js
function SomeComponent() {
    log('component called')

    function clickHandler() {
        setValue('...')
    }

    ....
    return (... {value} ...)
}
```

- whenever button is clicked, SomeComponent will be re-evaluated again
- when useState is executed, React knows that he has to use the latest snapshot of the variable
- but in DOM only value part will be rendered

## Rules of Hooks

- Only call in react functions
- Only call in react custom hooks

## Behind the scenes:

- coz of useState, react stores the initialized value
- when setState is called, react doesn't update the state immediately
- it schedules a state update process
- it might have other priority works to do.
- most cases it happens instantly

## state batching

```js
if(condition) {
setState1(...)
setState2(...)
}
```

- react have 1 batch process to update both states

## state handling in class based component

```jsx
constructor() {
    this.state = {...}
}

setState( (prevState,props) => {
    return {
        counter: prevState.counter + 1
    }
})
```

## Custom Hooks:

- can have stateful logic
- reusable
- use custom hook to deal with http data, loading and error state
- use useCallback as well when passing function
