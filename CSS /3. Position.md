# Position:

- to change the position anywhere
- top/left/bottom/right --> tells where to move in document flow from inital pos

## Positioning Context:

- Should be moved relative to itself ? 20px top from origial position
- Should be moved relative to html/body/any other Elements ? 20px from top of viewport

## STATIC:

- default value of position: static
- when static is set, Elements follow each other. They dont overlap

## FIXED:

- Element doesn't exist for other elements. Other elements can overlap
- Took out of actual document flow
- Change the general behaviour from block level to inline-block element
  -- Has viewport as Positioning Context

- if no top/left/bottom/right value is assigned, parent element is positioning context

## Z-Index:

- default value is auto (z-index: 0)
- z-index doesn't affect statically positioned elements

- if 2 z-indexes have same value with position !== static, the one comming after in DOM will overlap the first

## Absolute:

- not relative to the viewport
- if none of the ancestor has position property applied, then the positioning context will be html element
- else, closest ancestor is the position context

## Relative:

- doesn't take element out of documentflow
- works with Absolute

- moves itself relative to its current position in the documentflow

## Overflow:

- by assigning overflow as hidden in parent div, we can make sure that the child elements having relative position is hidden outside the parent div

- default behaviur of any webpage:
- if we assign overflow:hidden in body, it will be assigned to html element
- to solve this issue, assign it in both, body and html

## Sticky:

- Combination of relative and fixed

- When reached the condition, behaves as fixed
- Works in repect with viewport

- setting condition is necessary

- works under parent element

## Stacking Context:

```
<div> --> position:fixed
</div>
<div> --> position:fixed // z-index: 1
    <div> --> position:fixed
    <div> --> position:fixed
    <div> --> position:fixed. zindex:200 // it will always be below to last div in UI
</div>
<div> --> position:fixed, zindex:100
</div>
```

- child fixed positioned elements works in respect to its parent.
- created when applying position (except static) in combination of z-index
- defined stacking behaviour of child elements
